You can navigate through folders using the folder block. Folders can be sorted by date added and name. Navigation is also possible with the help of breadcrumbs.<br/>
You can copy the link to the current folder, so that for example, another user could also view media files (if access is configured for this user).

In the media files section, you can see your photos and videos stored in the current folder. The total number of files is displayed (if there are more than 50 on the current page, then 50+, 100+, etc. will be indicated).<br/>
